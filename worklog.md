## Current Project Status

### What's Working
- **Database**: Complete normalized schema with 10 models, all indexes, seeded with realistic data
- **API**: 23 endpoints for CRUD, movements, sales, reports, search
- **Frontend**: 11-page SPA with dashboard, catalog, operations, reports
- **Dashboard**: Real KPIs, charts, recent activity
- **Catalog**: Full product/equipment CRUD with compatibility management
- **Operations**: Receiving entries, sales with stock deduction, movements tracking
- **Reports**: 6 report types with charts and filters
- **Alerts**: Low stock warnings with severity levels

### Architecture Decisions
- **Single-page app**: All views in one route with Zustand-based navigation
- **SQLite + Prisma**: Perfect for pilot-scale (low-medium volume)
- **Desnormalized stock table + movement history**: Dual approach for fast reads + audit trail
- **Recharts**: Native React charts without heavy dependencies
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management with caching

### KPIs Available
- Stock total valorizado
- Products under minimum stock
- Sales (day/week/month)
- Movement count
- Dead stock analysis
- Top sellers
- Client sales ranking
- Equipment demand analysis
- Inventory rotation

### Known Issues / Future Work
- No authentication (acceptable for pilot)
- No multi-warehouse support (Phase 2)
- No ERP integration (Phase 2)
- Dashboard charts could show more data with more historical data
